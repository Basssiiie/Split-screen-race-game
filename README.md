# Split-screen-race-game
An example project for my class of 1st year Game Development students. The objective is to build a Split-screen Racer in 10 weeks.

The comments in the project are in Dutch, as the class is given in Dutch as well.

This project will go private after the summer, so download it if you want to keep a copy.
